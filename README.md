# The Finite Volume Method (FVM)
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has grown to be a complex field that requires a therough understanding of the specific problem one is seeking to solve and, naturally, of computational methods.
In this concise program we aim to focus on one specific scenario in order to build our intuition of the subject in a direct application of the finite volume method.
